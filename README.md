# CyclonePcbMill
Firmware and working tool versions for the Cyclone PCB Mill

## Firmware
Contains a copy of the firmware from https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory.git with a modified Configuration.h that works well with our machine.

## Toolchain
Contains working versions of apps that form part of the toolchain.  Specifically when we tried a later version of CNCGcodeController, it failed on the autolevel step, whereas this version works.
